Set off on a journey, from morning to night.

With colors so vivid, they’d light up the gloom.

And met a wise turtle, so old and so round.

And many great treasures you surely will find.”

Up mountains so high, where eagles did soar,
He climbed and he climbed, till he couldn’t no more.

And felt a warm glow, of achievement inside.

His dreams had come true, what a wonderful sight.
