            "He crossed a small stream, with a leap and a bound, and met a wise turtle, so old and so round.",
            "The turtle said, “Benny, be brave and be kind, and many great treasures you surely will find.",
            "Through forests so dense, where shadows did play, Benny found courage to not lose his way.",
            "Up mountains so high, where eagles did soar, he climbed and he climbed, till he couldn’t no more.",
            "At the peak, Benny gazed at the view far and wide, and felt a warm glow, of achievement inside.",
            "He danced in delight, in the soft twilight, his dreams had come true, what a wonderful sight.",
